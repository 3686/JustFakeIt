{
    const string expectedResult = "Some String Data";
    const string baseAddress = "http://localhost:12354";
    
    const string url = "/some-url";

    using (var fakeServer = new FakeServer(new Uri(baseAddress)))
    {
        fakeServer.Expect.Get(url).Returns(expectedResult);

        fakeServer.Start();

        var result = new WebClient().DownloadString(new Uri(baseAddress + url));
